# 📰 Dhanesh_!NEWS — API-Powered News Web App

**Dhanesh_!NEWS** is a modern, API-powered news web application built using **FastAPI, Jinja2, and NewsAPI**.  
It fetches live news articles from across the world and displays them in a clean, responsive, and animated UI.

This project demonstrates how to integrate **third-party APIs** with a backend server and render dynamic content on the web.
